This folder will be used by Next.js as the public assets directory.

Required structure for this portfolio:
- /public/images           -> General images (profile image: /images/profile.jpg)
- /public/projects         -> Project preview images
- /public/certifications   -> Certification images
- /public/blog-images      -> Blog post cover images

Place your actual image files inside these folders. The code already references
sample files like:
- /images/profile.jpg
- /projects/analytics-dashboard.jpg
- /certifications/aws-saa.png
- /blog-images/nextjs-intro.jpg

You can rename the files or paths in /data/siteData.js if needed.
